## About The Crying-Html Project.
This script is a small project used for bug bounty, so far what I have put some simple things such as
* Look at the source code of the website.
* Download the source code of the website.
* Find all the links in the website.
* Find all the subdomains of the website.
* Find the IP of the website.
* Using Nmap To Scan Vulnerability.

But I will add other features in the future.
